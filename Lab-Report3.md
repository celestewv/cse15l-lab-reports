## Researching  for Alternate Ways to Use Commands
### Chosen Command: ```find```

### Background Information on the ```find``` Command:

According to the Linux manual page the ```find``` command “searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name. If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.”
